# MW-Editor
 
This is a map editor made by leafized.
This mod enables the ability to add models to a map and create custom game modes.

This mod is a base mod for multiple versions of my game modes including battle royale.

Can be implemented into any menu / mod, just copy all files except for main.gsc into your folder,
and add the init script from main.gsc to your init.
